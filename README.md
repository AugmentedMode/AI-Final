# Rubik's Cube

Hello! We built an agent and environment that is able to solve a 2x2 Rubikâ€™s cube utilizing Q-learning along with a 2D visualization! <br>

#### There are still a lot of features we are currently working on to implemtent such as:
* Completing 'Run' file
* Build better metric tracking with real-time visualizations
* Reducing the number of states needed in the q-table
* Design a more intelligent reward function
* Implement a 3D visualization using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
